## Plan
Based on our experiences on web development and descriptions metioned above, we take _Feb, 2016_ as the __1st stage__ with the __primary__ goal of __prototyping__ our own generic web crawler. Here're some tentative schedules.

* __[2016/02/01 - 2016/02/07]__ Project Selection, Plan Discussion, and Proposal Draft Writing
* __[2016/02/08 - 2016/02/24]__ System Design, Resource Discovery, Project Implementation, Document Writing 
* __[2016/02/25 - 2016/02/29]__ User Manual Writing and Presentation Making

_Details of each schedule and task will be added later._

## Language & Framework

Python

## Development Guildlines

- __Modularity.__ Following the principle _"loose coupling and high cohesion"_, each module should be standalone.

- __Minimalism.__ Each module should be kept short, simple, and concise. Every piece of code should be transparent upon first reading. 
- __Easy extensibility.__ New modules (as new classes and functions) are should be simply add, and existing modules should be extended easily.
